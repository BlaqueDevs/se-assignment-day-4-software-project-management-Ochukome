**Project Suitability:**  
- Agile is best for complex, evolving projects with changing requirements.  
- Waterfall works well for structured projects with clear, fixed goals.  

**Time & Cost Estimation:**  
- Agile can be harder to estimate due to evolving scope.  
- Waterfall is easier to predict since everything is planned upfront.  

**Collaboration:**  
- Agile encourages regular teamwork and stakeholder involvement.  
- Waterfall has less frequent interaction with stakeholders.  

**Advantages & Disadvantages**  

**Agile:**  
- Quick adaptation to changes  
- Continuous improvement through feedback
